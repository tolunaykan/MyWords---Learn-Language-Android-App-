If you have difficulty memorizing the word while learning a language, it is an application for you.😍 Add the word you want to your list with the corresponding language in the foreign language and practice until you learn.✍ While considering word, that picture will come to your mind and you will be able to form sentences very easily.🤔

There are 3 lists: 
- Known Words 
- Unknown Words 
- Unsure Words

Thanks to these lists, you will be able to move the word you learned to the known list and the word you are not sure to the relevant list. 😵

You can edit the words, change their pictures or delete the word at any time. 💼⏱

The application is not dependent on any language. You can memorize words using the language you want. You can learn any language like Turkish, English, Spanish, Arabic, Italian, Japanese, Chinese, French, German.
